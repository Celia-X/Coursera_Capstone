    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> Beijing is divided into 16 districts as shown in the Figure 1.1 below. Different districts have not only different area sizes and population, but also various venues. From the perspective of a business investor, espacially in the field of sales and marketing, it should be very interesting to learn the details of the city. Considering that Beijing is a crowded city, which may result in more potential consumers, a business inverstor would like to start his business in this city. Although there is a great market, the investor should also think about the type of business he will start. The optimal solution as expected should be the district with intense population density but few competitors. </div>"
